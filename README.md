# The Rainbow Room

The Rainbow Room is an experiment in sequencing. The interface is text based, reminiscent of an interactive fiction story.

You move between different rooms, each with a unique sound generation machine.

The Rainbow Room is some sort of distant cousin to [Conway Twitty’s Game of Life](https://spitlo.com/ctgol/), [PIKSEQ](https://spitlo.com/pikseq/), [/'siːkwənt/](https://spitlo.com/sikwent/) and [Space](https://spitlo.com/space/). It’s an ever growing family of experimental sequencers!

It uses [Strudel](https://strudel.cc) for sounds and [text-engine](https://github.com/okaybenji/text-engine/) for interactive fiction interface.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a work in progress. Also, if you ever want to "play" the actual "game" once it’s "done", remember there might be spoilers in this code.
